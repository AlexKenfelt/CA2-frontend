# This repository includes our frontend for our start code for the coming term project

The frontend includes a feature where we can login using our login endpoint implemented in our backend code. In the header you can see a page for the user and the admin, but you canâ€™t see the content before you login. 
Here you can log in to the website with a username and password for either user or admin. 
When you have logged in as a user, you can still not see the content of the admin and the other way around.
